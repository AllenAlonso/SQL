# SQL

Uses SQL Postgress in order to comb through various csv files, an ERD image file is included of the organization of the project using https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/

The employee_table_schemata holds the information about the schema for table creation and relation between tables. I found it unecessary to give primary keys to each table since I ensured the csv files had accurate foreign keys.

In the employee_queries sql file I search for the following information:
-  List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee 
-  List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986 
-  List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name 
-  List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name 
-  List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B 
-  List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name 
-  List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
-  List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)
